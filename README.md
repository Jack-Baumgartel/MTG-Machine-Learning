# MTG-Machine-Learning
A brief demonstration that uses a convolutional neural network to recognize Magic the Gathering cards.

I'm embarking on a project to bring a cheap & effective trading card sorter to market. This is the second repository that I've shared tackling the card recognition software. See links below for earlier work and a demonstration video that accompanies this repository. This demo shows just how effective machine learning can be at solving a complex task like card recognition. There are many hurdles still to overcome before a similar implementation can be used at scale, yet I hope to show how promising these early results are for the project.
